# One-Pot Vegetarian Chili
_At the age of eight, my family fled the only home I knew in Cairo, Egypt. The dictator, Mubarak, had been violently supressing protesters and holding the city under Marshal Law._

_We kept waiting for everything to go back to normal, but in truth, after the first protests the country could never go back. My parents, my six-year-old younger sister and I planned our escape. If we could get the airport, we could get a flight to somewhere else. Anywhere else, really._

_My mother, my sister and I were able to make it out, but my father got seperated. He did not show up at the plane, but we had to leave anyway. It was just too dangerous to wait._

_We fled to Jordan, then to Spain. I spent the next three months of my life oscilating between terror and numb dispair. Was dad safe? Was he alive? What happens when your life is uprooted so violently?_

_Every night we looked at the list of pictures of the people arested. I was not sure if I wanted him to be there or not._
_The American news was far better than the news run by the state, but it lacked so many critical details. I watched Americans talk about this issue over footage of people fighting and dying outside the pallace. It was like they couldn't fathom that those figures down below were actual human beings. I wanted to scream at their calm demeanor and discussion of a comprimise between the tyrant and the people demanding human rights._

_I kept going over that day we fled again and again. Was there something I could have done? Why did I get to escapoe if he couldn't? Was there really sa loving god watching over us, and if so how could they let this happen? I came to realise that that was the day I lost my childhood. I learned that power is just freedom that is stolen from others, and I learned just how much that freedom can cost._

_This vegetarian chili is a hearty and nutritious meal that's perfect for cold nights. Plus, it's made in one pot, so cleanup is a breeze._
